 * Interface describing a given synchronization policy with the Realm Object Server.

 * The sole purpose of classes implementing this interface is to call {@link SyncSession#bind()} and
 * {@link SyncSession#unbind()} as needed, which will control when changes are synchronized between a local and
 * remote Realm.
 *
 * The SyncPolicy is not responsible for managing the lifecycle of the {@link SyncSession} in general. So any
 * implementation of this class should avoid calling {@link SyncSession#stop()} and
 * {@link SyncSession#start()}.
 *
 * If a session is stopped, {@link SyncSession#unbind()} is automatically called and any further calls to
 * {@link SyncSession#bind()} and {@link SyncSession#unbind()} are ignored.
 * {@link #onSessionStopped(SyncSession)} ()} will then be called so the sync policy have a chance to clean up
 * any resources it might be using.
