/**
 * Credentials represent a login with a 3rd party login provider in an OAuth2 login flow, and are used by the Realm
 * Object Server to verify the user and grant access.
 * <p>
 * Logging into the Realm Object Server consists of the following steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 *     Login to 3rd party like Facebook, Google or Twitter. The result is usually an Authorization Grant that must be
 *     saved in a {@link Credentials} object of the proper type, e.g {@link Credentials#fromFacebook(String)} for a
 *     Facebook login.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     Authenticate a {@link User} through the Realm Object Server using these credentials. Once authenticated
 *     a Realm Object Server user is returned. This user can then be attached to a {@link SyncConfiguration}, which
 *     will make it possible to synchronize data between the local and remote Realm.
 *     <p>
 *     It is possible to persist the user object using e.g. the {@link UserStore} so logging
 *     into e.g Facebook is only required the first time the app is used.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // Example
 *
 * Credentials credentials = Credentials.fromFacebook(getFacebookToken());
 * boolean createUser = true;
 * User.authenticateUser(credentials, new URL("http://objectserver.realm.io/auth", new User.Callback() {
 *     \@Override
 *     public void onSuccess(User user) {
 *          userStore.saveUser("key", user)
 *          // User is now authenticated and be be used to open Realms.
 *     }
 *
 *     \@Override
 *     public void onError(ObjectServerError error) {
 *
 *     }
