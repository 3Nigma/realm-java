/**
 * AUTHENTICATING State. This step is needed if the user does not have proper access or credentials to access this
 * Realm when attempting to bind it. This can happen in 3 ways:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *          <b>Refresh token has expired:</b>
 *          This effectively means the user has been logged out from the Realm Object Server and credentials has
 *          to be re-verified on the Authentication Server. Since this involves creating a new User object object,
 *          this session will be stopped and and error reported.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *          <b>Access token has expired:</b>
 *          This state will automatically refresh it and retry binding the Realm.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *          <b>Access token does not exists:</b>
 *          This state means the user has logged in, but not yet gained a specific access token for this Realm.
 *          This state will automatically fetch the access token and retry binding the Realm.
 *      </li>
 * </ol>
